# Azure AI-900

This project was developed for the bootcamp Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals, a partnership between Microsoft and DIO. This bootcamp provides an introduction to cloud services on Azure and how these tools can be used to create ML models and AI technologies.


The main goal here was to create a Machine Learn Model using Azure Machine Learning Workspace, following the steps from [Microdoft Learn](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/mslearn-ai-fundamentals/Instructions/Labs/01-machine-learning.html#create-an-azure-machine-learning-workspace).

### The Project

**1** - The first step is to create a resource, it's here that your programs will be run. <br>
**2** - Then, using Azure Machine Learning studio, create a new Automated ML job.
> Here you will define what's your goal and which resources and methods you would like to use.
> In this case, we created a ML model to predict bike rental with a regression, using RandomForest and LightGBM models.
